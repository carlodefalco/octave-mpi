1) INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The makefile included derives all the info it needs for building the code 
from running mpic++, so make sure that mpicc is in your path before running Octave
or type 

putenv ("PATH", "/path/to/mpic++:${PATH}")

from within Octave.
Once this is done you should be able to install openmpi_ext from a locally dowloaded tarball
by doing:

pkg install mpi-<version>.tar.gz

or directly from the ftp server by doing

pkg install -forge mpi


2) ORIGINAL README


Below are the contents of the original README file included with the first release
by R. Corradini, I am not sure all the info there still make sense but they are still
reported here, just in case ...

The code is general-purpose, but  I would like to use it for econometrics.
So the first step will be to install the following tarball from
http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.3/downloads/openmpi-1.3.3.tar.bz2
possibly in a multi-core computer to run my simple examples
and configure it for instance in the following way (/home/user is your $HOME)
./configure --enable-mpirun-prefix-by-default --enable-heterogeneous --prefix=/home/user/openmpi-1.3.3/ --enable-static

and modify .bashrc in your home
 OMPIBIN=`$ompi_info -path     bindir  -parsable | cut -d: -f3`
 OMPILIB=`$ompi_info -path     libdir  -parsable | cut -d: -f3`
 OMPISCD=`$ompi_info -path sysconfdir  -parsable | cut -d: -f3`



export            PATH=$OMPIBIN:$PATH

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:$OMPILIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

unset  ompi_info OMPIBIN OMPILIB OMPISCD 

If you want to install it on a simple toy network, just assign a static ip address on every linux computer and set up 
an ssh connection with no password (see for instance http://linuxproblem.org/art_9.html ) and then install openmpi and octave always with the same versions and with the same info on .bashrc for the same user.

After this type in a terminal mpiCC --showme
In my case I will have something like

g++ -I/home/user/openmpi-1.3.3/include -pthread -L/home/user/openmpi-1.3.3/lib -lmpi_cxx -lmpi -lopen-rte -lopen-pal -ldl -Wl,--export-dynamic -lnsl -lutil -lm -ldl

This will be useful for mkoctfile
for instance for MPI_Init.cc we shall have
mkoctfile -I/home/user/openmpi-1.3.3/include -lpthread -L/home/user/openmpi-1.3.3/lib -lmpi_cxx -lmpi -lopen-rte -lopen-pal -ldl -lnsl -lutil -lm -ldl MPI_Init.cc



The m files just contain some very simple examples
More complex examples will be provided in the next future.

to understand the logic of MPI Derived Datatypes and how could they be easily handled by openmpi_ext package.
